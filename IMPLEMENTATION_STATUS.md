# Implementation Status

## Completed Features

### 1. Context-Aware Expression Matching ✓
- **File**: `semantic_bud_expressions/context_aware_expression.py`
- **Status**: Implemented and functional
- **Features**:
  - Matches expressions based on both pattern and semantic context
  - Multiple context extraction strategies (word-based, sentence, paragraph, auto)
  - Context comparison methods (direct embedding, chunked mean)
  - Configurable similarity thresholds
  - Context caching for performance

### 2. FAISS Integration for Large-Scale Similarity Search ✓
- **File**: `semantic_bud_expressions/faiss_manager.py`
- **Status**: Implemented with numpy fallback
- **Features**:
  - Automatic index type selection based on dataset size
  - Support for Flat, IVF, and HNSW indices
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Graceful fallback to numpy when FAISS not available
  - GPU acceleration support (when available)
  - Index persistence (save/load)

### 3. Enhanced Semantic Parameter Types ✓
- **File**: `semantic_bud_expressions/semantic_parameter_type.py`
- **Status**: Updated with FAISS support
- **Features**:
  - Auto-enables FAISS for 100+ prototypes
  - Seamless integration with existing API
  - Performance improvements for large prototype sets

## Test Results

### Context Matching Tests
- **Basic functionality**: ✓ Working
- **Context extraction**: ✓ Fixed and working
- **Some edge cases**: ⚠️ Need fixes (6 test failures)

### FAISS Integration Tests
- **Core functionality**: ✓ Working
- **Numpy fallback**: ✓ Working
- **Performance**: ✓ Significant speedup demonstrated
- **Minor issues**: ⚠️ 2 test failures in edge cases

## Demo Results

### Context-Aware Matching
✓ Successfully differentiates between automotive and non-automotive contexts
✓ Correctly matches "I love Tesla" only in car-related context

### FAISS Integration
✓ Handles 100+ prototypes efficiently
✓ Accurate similarity matching
✓ Auto-enables for large datasets

### Combined Features
✓ Context-aware matching with semantic types works correctly
✓ Distinguishes car dealership context from other contexts

## Known Issues

1. **Test Failures**: Some edge case tests are failing, particularly:
   - Multiple matches with different contexts
   - Some context extraction edge cases
   - FAISS auto-index selection test

2. **Parameters Not Captured**: The matched parameters are showing as empty `{}` in some cases

3. **Warning**: FAISS clustering warning when prototype count is low relative to cluster count

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining test failures
2. Investigate why parameters aren't being captured in context matches
3. Add more comprehensive examples
4. Update documentation with new features
5. Performance benchmarking for large-scale use cases
